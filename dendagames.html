                <h3>My role within the company</h3>
                <p>
                    In my role within the company, I am responsible for creating both low fidelity and high fidelity designs, implementing new technologies and optimising existing systems to improve overall performance. 
                    I developed a comprehensive library system to ensure a smoother, more organised and consistent workflow in Figma, and I regularly collaborate with teams across different departments to help achieve our product goals. 
                    I also create product roadmaps to provide clear visualisations of a product’s vision and priorities, ensuring alignment across the team. 
                    In addition, I design progression systems and in game economies for various games and client products, and I support new interns by offering guidance throughout their onboarding and development.

                <h3>User journey for the HTML5 games</h3>
                <p>
                    In my role as a Game Designer, I led the creation of the new game flow for the HTML5 games we were developing for a new client. 
                    I collaborated closely with the Technical Game Producer to design a user journey that ensured easy and intuitive navigation for players.
                    This flow was a key factor in the success of the games, as the target audience consists of people aged 35 to 65 who enjoy playing casual games within a news and media environment.

                <h3>Library of Components</h3>
                <p>
                    Another task was to research and come up with a method that would increase the productivity of our HTML5 products, but also mantain the consistency among all the casual games.
                    This narrowed into creating a library of components in figma with the main screens, icons and colours. 
                    By doing this, everyone in the design and art department would have access to a cohesive, and ready-to-use designes that maintains spacing and margin along the desings

                    <h1>Variables</h1>
                    <h3>Colours Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since the company's product are meant to be playable in multiple environments, including websites and apps, there was a requirement that we needed to achieve, dark mode.
                        After creating the library of components, then I proceed to create the colour variables for dark mode which needed the usage of some colour theory in order to make it readable, cohesive and clean.

                    <h3>Language Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have both international clients and national (Dutch) clients. For this, the best way to showcase a game to potential clients, is to do it in a language that almost everyone speaks, English.
                        I created another variables for both English and Dutch that allows the products to be changed with one single tap/click.
